What I'm Building
I'm a Security Engineer working at the intersection of cloud compliance and security automation — translating compliance requirements into code that enforces them continuously, as a built-in property of the system rather than an audit process layered on top of it.
This GitHub documents that work publicly. The portfolio is designed to show a deliberate arc: early work demonstrates deep compliance understanding, later work demonstrates that understanding enforced in code.

The expert track: Automated security enforcement at the infrastructure and pipeline layer — taking any compliance requirement and making it machine-enforceable at scale.


Current Focus
yamldomains:      Cloud Compliance | Security Automation | Control Framework Mapping
frameworks:   NIST 800-53 | CCF | SOC 2 | FedRAMP
building:     Compliance foundation → security automation portfolio
learning:     AWS Solutions Architect Associate | CISA prep
next:         AWS Security Specialty → Terraform → CCNP → CCSP

The Certification Roadmap
2025  ──── AWS Solutions Architect Associate
      ──── CISA

2026  ──── AWS Security Specialty       ← automation targets
      ──── Terraform Associate          ← expert track foundation
      ──── CCNP                         ← Cisco differentiator
      ──── CCSP                         ← federal + J2 stack

2027  ──── CKA (Kubernetes Admin)       ← runtime enforcement
      ──── AWS SAP                      ← architecture authority
      ──── SANS SEC540                  ← capstone

How I Think About This Work
Most compliance engineers know what a control requires.
Most security engineers know how to build systems.
Few people can take a compliance requirement and enforce it in code — continuously, automatically, without human intervention.
That intersection — compliance depth meeting security automation — is the vertical bar I am building.
Every repo here is a step along that arc. Early repos show understanding. Later repos show enforcement.

Background

Credential: CompTIA Security+
Studying: Computer Engineering — Georgia Tech / GSU Atlanta
Domain experience: Cloud compliance, control framework mapping, security automation
Building toward: Security Automation Engineer → DevSecOps IC → Federal Cybersecurity Practice

I came into security engineering through a technical sales background — two years working with enterprise security teams before moving to the engineering side. That experience gave me something most security engineers lack: I understand why controls exist, not just how to implement them. That context is what makes security automation meaningful rather than mechanical.

A Note on What I Share
Everything here is built from public frameworks — NIST, CIS, AWS documentation, vendor compliance reports. The goal is demonstrating how I think, not exposing how anyone else operates.

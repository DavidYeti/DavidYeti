## What I'm Building

I'm a Security Engineer working at the intersection of **cloud compliance** and **control
framework mapping** — translating complex cloud environments into auditable, evidence-backed
compliance postures using frameworks like NIST 800-53, CCF, and SOC 2.

This GitHub is where I document that work publicly — control mappings, governance frameworks,
and the applied knowledge I'm accumulating on the road from compliance engineering to DevSecOps.

> **The goal:** Become an L6/L7 individual contributor DevSecOps engineer with deep compliance
> roots, cloud architecture authority, and eventually — my own federal cybersecurity practice.

---

## Current Focus

```yaml
domains:      Cloud Compliance | Security Automation | Control Framework Mapping
frameworks:   NIST 800-53 | CCF | SOC 2 | FedRAMP
building:     Compliance foundation → security automation portfolio
learning:     AWS Solutions Architect Associate | CISA prep
next:         AWS Security Specialty → Terraform → CCNP → CCSP
```

---

## The Certification Roadmap

I certify in parallel with hands-on experience — not before it.

```
2025  ──── AWS Solutions Architect Associate
      ──── CISA

2026  ──── AWS Security Specialty       ← automation targets
      ──── Terraform Associate          ← expert track foundation
      ──── CCNP                         ← Cisco differentiator
      ──── CCSP                         ← federal + J2 stack

2027  ──── CKA (Kubernetes Admin)       ← runtime enforcement
      ──── AWS SAP                      ← architecture authority
      ──── SANS SEC540                  ← capstone
```

## How I Think About This Work

Most compliance engineers can tell you what a control requires.
Fewer can tell you *why* it exists, *what evidence satisfies it*, and
*how a cloud product actually produces that evidence*.

That gap — between knowing the framework and understanding the system —
is what this portfolio is about closing.

Every repo here starts with a real question I encountered in my work.
The answer becomes the artifact. That's the opposite of tutorial hell,
and it's how practitioners actually learn.

## Writing & Videos

I publish short technical explainers on cloud compliance, control frameworks,
and the compliance → DevSecOps career path.

## Background

- **Credential:** CompTIA Security+
- **Studying:** Computer Engineering — GSU Perimeter
- **Domain experience:** Cloud compliance, control framework mapping, security architecture
- **Building toward:** Security Automation Engineer → DevSecOps IC → Federal Cybersecurity Practice

I came into security engineering through a technical sales background — almost two years 
working with enterprise security teams before moving to the engineering side. That experience 
gave me something most security engineers lack: I understand why controls exist, not just how
to implement them. That context is what makes security automation meaningful rather than
mechanical.

## A Note on What I Share

Everything in this portfolio is built from public frameworks — NIST, CIS, AWS documentation,
vendor compliance reports. I don't publish internal tooling, proprietary processes, or
anything that isn't mine to share.

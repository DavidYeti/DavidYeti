## What I'm Building

I'm a Security Engineer working at the intersection of **cloud compliance** and **control
framework mapping** — translating complex cloud environments into auditable, evidence-backed
compliance postures using frameworks like NIST 800-53, CCF, and SOC 2.

This GitHub is where I document that work publicly — control mappings, governance frameworks,
and the applied knowledge I'm accumulating working at the intersection of compliance and security automation.

> **The focus:** Deep expertise in security automation at the infrastructure and pipeline layer —
> taking any compliance requirement and making it machine-enforceable at scale.

---

## Current Focus

```yaml
domains:      Cloud Compliance | Security Automation | Control Framework Mapping
frameworks:   NIST 800-53 | CCF | SOC 2 | FedRAMP
building:     Control mapping → security automation in code
learning:     AWS Solutions Architect Associate | CISA prep
studying:     CISA | AWS Solutions Architect Associate
```

## The Certification Roadmap

Every credential deepens something I am already applying in practice.

```  
2025  ──── CompTIA Security+            ← core cybersecurity functions

2026  ──── AWS SAA                      ← design cloud infrastructure
      ──── CISA                         ← reduce infrastructure risk
      ──── AWS Security Specialty       ← automation targets
      ──── Terraform Associate          ← expert track foundation
      ──── CCNP                         ← enterprise network infrastructure
     
2027  ──── CCSP                         ← data & application security
      ──── CKA (Kubernetes Admin)       ← runtime enforcement
      ──── AWS SAP                      ← architecture authority
      ──── SANS SEC540                  ← capstone
```

## How I Think About This Work

Most compliance engineers can tell you what a control requires.
Fewer can tell you *why* it exists, *what evidence satisfies it*, and
*how a cloud product actually produces that evidence*.

That gap — between knowing the framework and understanding the system —
is what this portfolio is about closing.

Every repo here starts with a real question I encountered in my work.
The answer becomes the artifact. That's the opposite of tutorial hell,
and it's how practitioners actually learn.

## Writing & Videos

I publish short technical explainers on cloud compliance, control frameworks,
and security automation for practitioners.

## Background

- **Credential:** CompTIA Security+
- **Studying:** Computer Engineering — GSU Perimeter College
- **Domain experience:** Cloud compliance, control framework mapping, security architecture
- **Focus:** Cloud compliance, security automation, and the engineering craft.

I came into security engineering through a technical sales background — two years working
with enterprise security teams before moving to the engineering side. That experience gave
me something most security engineers lack: I understand why controls exist, not just how
to implement them. That context is what makes security automation meaningful rather than
mechanical.

## A Note on What I Share

Everything in this portfolio is built from public frameworks — NIST, CIS, AWS documentation,
vendor compliance reports. I don't publish internal tooling, proprietary processes, or
anything that isn't mine to share.
